This is  a simple java code which shows how an ATM machine works.
I just started to learn java language and whatever i learned today i implemented it on the code.
I have take every situation that a user can face while using atm. 
Well in future i will sure make changes in the code as i made this project to test my coding skills. And just to know how much i learned from todays bootcamp session.
